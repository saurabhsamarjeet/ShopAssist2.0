# GenAI-Based Shopping Assistant: ShopAssist AI

## 1. Background

In today’s fast-paced digital age, online shopping has become the preferred method for consumers worldwide. However, the sheer volume of choices, coupled with the lack of personalized guidance, often makes the shopping experience overwhelming and time-consuming. To address these challenges, we have developed **ShopAssist AI**, an intelligent chatbot that combines the power of **large language models (LLMs)** and **rule-based functions** to deliver accurate, personalized, and reliable product recommendations. 

ShopAssist AI is designed to simplify the online shopping experience by acting as a virtual shopping assistant. It leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) capabilities to understand user preferences, ask relevant questions, and provide tailored recommendations. By integrating conversational AI with a structured dataset, ShopAssist AI ensures that users find the best products that match their needs.

## 2. Problem Statement

Given a dataset containing detailed information about laptops (e.g., product names, specifications, descriptions, etc.), the goal is to build a chatbot that can:

1. **Parse the dataset** to understand product features and descriptions.
2. **Engage in natural conversations** with users to gather their requirements (e.g., budget, preferred specifications, usage scenarios).
3. **Provide accurate and personalized laptop recommendations** based on the user’s inputs.
4. **Handle user queries** efficiently and guide them through the decision-making process.

The chatbot must balance the flexibility of conversational AI with the precision of rule-based logic to ensure reliable and relevant recommendations.

## 3. Approach

The development of ShopAssist AI follows a structured approach to ensure seamless functionality and user satisfaction:

### 3.1 Conversation and Information Gathering
- The chatbot uses **large language models (LLMs)** to engage users in natural, human-like conversations.
- It asks targeted questions to gather essential information about the user’s preferences, such as:
  - Budget range
  - Desired screen size
  - Processing power (e.g., Intel i5, i7, AMD Ryzen)
  - RAM and storage requirements
  - Intended usage (e.g., gaming, work, casual use)
- The conversational flow is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, ensuring that users feel guided rather than interrogated.

### 3.2 Information Extraction
- Once the chatbot collects sufficient information, **rule-based functions** are employed to extract the most relevant data from the dataset.
- These functions analyze the dataset (`laptop_data.csv`) and filter out laptops that match the user’s requirements.
- The system identifies the **top 3 laptops** that best align with the user’s preferences.

### 3.3 Personalized Recommendation
- The chatbot engages in further dialogue with the user to refine the recommendations.
- It provides detailed explanations for each recommendation, highlighting key features and benefits.
- Users can ask follow-up questions, and the chatbot will respond with accurate and context-aware answers.

## 4. System Functionalities

ShopAssist AI offers a range of functionalities to enhance the user experience:

### 4.1 User Interface
- A **user-friendly web interface** allows users to interact with the chatbot seamlessly.
- The interface is designed to be intuitive, ensuring that users of all technical levels can navigate it effortlessly.

### 4.2 Conversational AI
- The core of ShopAssist AI is powered by **OpenAI’s chat model**, which enables natural and engaging conversations.
- The chatbot guides users through the process of specifying their requirements and provides real-time responses.

### 4.3 User Input Moderation
- To ensure a safe and respectful interaction, user inputs are moderated using **OpenAI’s moderation API**.
- Inappropriate or offensive content is flagged, and the chatbot responds appropriately to maintain a positive user experience.

### 4.4 User Profile Extraction
- The chatbot extracts key information from the conversation to build a **user profile**.
- Using **OpenAI’s function calling mechanism**, the chatbot converts user requirements into a structured JSON object, which is then used to filter and recommend products.

### 4.5 Dataset Integration
- The system leverages a dataset (`laptopData.csv`) that contains detailed information about various laptops, including:
  - Product names
  - Specifications (e.g., processor, RAM, storage, screen size)
  - Descriptions (e.g., usage scenarios, unique features)
- The chatbot parses the `Description` column using LLMs to provide context-aware recommendations.

## 5. System Architecture

ShopAssist AI follows a **client-server architecture** to ensure scalability and efficiency:

### 5.1 Client-Side
- Users interact with the chatbot through a **web-based interface**.
- The interface is hosted on a server and accessible via a browser.

### 5.2 Server-Side
- The server runs a **Flask application** that handles user requests and interacts with external APIs.
- The Flask application performs the following tasks:
  - **Routing:** Maps user requests to appropriate functions based on URLs.
  - **Conversation Management:** Manages conversation initiation, response generation, and history maintenance.
  - **User Input Processing:** Captures user input, performs moderation checks, and extracts user profiles.
  - **Recommendation Logic:** Compares user profiles with laptop data and generates personalized recommendations.

### 5.3 External APIs
- The system interacts with **OpenAI’s API** for:
  - **Conversation generation:** Generating natural and context-aware responses.
  - **Moderation:** Ensuring user inputs are appropriate.
  - **Function calling:** Converting user requirements into structured JSON objects.

### 5.4 Data Storage
- The laptop dataset (`laptopData.csv`) is stored externally and accessed by the Flask application for filtering and recommendation purposes.

# Chatbot System Design

## Workflow Overview

1. **Start Conversation**
   - The chatbot initiates a conversation with the user.

2. **User Input**
   - The chatbot asks a series of questions to gather the user's requirements.

3. **Intent Confirmation**
   - The chatbot confirms the user's intent by asking follow-up questions to ensure all requirements are accurately identified.

4. **Product Mapping**
   - The chatbot maps the user's requirements to the available products in the dataset.

5. **Product Information Extraction**
   - The chatbot extracts relevant product information based on the user's requirements.

6. **Product Recommendation**
   - The chatbot recommends the most relevant products to the user.

7. **End Conversation**
   - The chatbot ends the conversation once the user is satisfied with the recommendations and chooses to exit.

This structured workflow ensures that the chatbot effectively gathers user requirements, provides accurate product recommendations, and delivers a seamless user experience.
